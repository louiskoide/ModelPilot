# M6 benchmark plan: repository tasks, graders and arms (items 3–4)

Status: plan written September 22, 2026. Nothing here is built yet. Item 3 is the task corpus and harness. Item 4 runs the arms. The ModelPilot arm's behavior is proposed in `docs/m6-modelpilot-policy.md`.

## Question

Across realistic Claude Code repository tasks, what does each arm cost per passed task, and at what pass rate and wall time? The current M6 smoke test (16 one-turn direct-API requests) cannot answer that. It is not reused as a baseline.

## Arms

All arms use the same tasks, tools, per-task limits, graders and isolation, and the same models (Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 5, Opus 5).

| Arm | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed Opus 5 | `--model claude-opus-5`, default effort |
| Fixed Sonnet 5 | `--model claude-sonnet-5`, default effort |
| Fixed Haiku 4.5 | `--model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (lower bound on cost) |
| Stock Jev | pinned, unmodified. With current Claude Code it does not route, so it is reported as a fixed-Opus arm plus router overhead |
| Compat Jev | pinned plus the one-line patch (`work/jev-router-compat`), reported with `rejected_requests`, `extra_decisions` and router usage |
| ModelPilot | policy in `docs/m6-modelpilot-policy.md`, active for this arm only, after user approval |

Every arm runs through ModelPilot's proxy for wire accounting. That arrangement already reconciles Jev exactly. Claude Code's own cost figures are never used for Jev or ModelPilot.

## Task corpus (mined from real repositories)

**Repository selection:**
- permissive license (MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0), recorded per repo;
- mostly pure Python, with dependencies installable once into a pinned local environment;
- full test suite under 60 s and deterministic across 3 runs;
- small enough for a fresh copy per trial;
- aim for 8–12 repos, no more than 6 tasks from any one repo.

**Task construction (SWE-bench style):**
1. Find commits that fix a bug or add a small feature **and** add or change tests.
2. The base state is the commit's parent. The **hidden grader** is the tests the commit added or changed.
3. Automatic validation, where any failure drops the task:
   - fail-to-pass: the hidden tests fail on base and pass on the commit;
   - pass-to-pass: the rest of the suite passes on both;
   - flake check: 3 runs each;
   - runtime is recorded.
4. The instruction is written from the linked issue, or from the commit message if there is none. It is reviewed so it doesn't reveal the fix and records its source. The hidden tests are never in the task checkout.
5. Tasks are tagged by type: bug fix, small feature, or read-only question with an exact-answer grader.

**Corpus format:** `bench/tasks/<id>/task.json` holds the repo URL, pinned base commit, reference commit, instruction, hidden test paths, test command, type, license and source link. The corpus lists task IDs and hashes. Checkouts and hidden tests are fetched into ignored `work/bench/` and never committed. Only metadata is committed, never third-party source.

**Split:** about 40 validated tasks. About 15 go to tuning and about 25 to final evaluation, **split by repository** so no repo appears in both. The final split's task hashes are recorded before any policy tuning. The final split runs once per frozen policy version.

## Session shapes (so cache effects actually occur)

A single `-p` prompt never idles, so the cold-cache lever would never trigger. Each task therefore runs in one of two strata:
- **Single prompt:** one instruction, many tool calls.
- **Follow-up:** the instruction, then one or two scripted follow-ups (for example "now also handle X" or "run the full suite and fix anything you broke"), resumed in the same session. The follow-up gap is 0 s (warm) or 330 s (cold, just past M0's measured expiry).

Each run records its stratum, and results are reported per stratum.

## Harness (`modelpilot/bench.py`, new)

- **Isolation per trial:** fresh checkout copy under `runs/bench-<ts>/<task>/<arm>/<trial>/`, isolated HOME, TMPDIR and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `--setting-sources ''`, strict empty MCP config (except ModelPilot's tools in its own arm), `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES=0`, no automatic retries.
- **Identical limits:** the same `--tools` list, `--max-turns` and `--max-budget-usd` per task for every arm. The ModelPilot arm's enforced budget uses the same limit.
- **Launchers:** fixed arms use `claude --model`. Jev arms reuse `jev_route_check` / `jev_accounted_launch.mjs` (compat patch built by `jev_compat --prepare-compat`). The ModelPilot arm reuses `governed_session` (proxy, hooks, declared correction channel).
- **Grading after the session ends:** copy the final tree, restore the hidden tests (and overwrite any test file the agent changed), run the test command in a subprocess **without provider credentials**, then check fail-to-pass and pass-to-pass. Read-only tasks use exact-answer grading. The grader never sees model output except the final tree or answer.
- **Records per trial:** pass/fail and reason, and cost from wire accounting (uncached input, 5m/1h writes, reads, output, rejected requests, router usage marked as unpriced, fallback and verifier calls). Also turns, requests, wall time, time to first token, stratum, and model/effort per request.
- **Order:** the run order of task × arm × trial is randomized with a recorded seed. Arms of the same task and trial are paired for analysis.

## Analysis

- Per arm: pass rate, mean cost per task, **cost per passed task**, and wall time, each with a paired bootstrap 95% interval.
- Paired differences against the best fixed arm and against compat Jev.
- Unknown cost is reported as unknown. A trial with unknown cost is excluded from dollar totals, listed and counted, and never priced at zero.
- Failure categories: grader fail, turn limit, budget stop, transport error, rejected-request loops.
- No winner is claimed from overlapping intervals, and nothing uses the tuning split's results.

## Phases and cost

| Phase | Output | API cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3a | Mining and validation tooling, 5 validated tasks from 2 repos | $0 |
| 3b | `bench.py` harness, validated end to end against the scripted loopback fixture with the real client | $0 |
| 3c | Live pilot: 2 tasks × fixed Sonnet 5 and fixed Opus 5 × 1 trial, to check graders, limits and per-session cost | about $2–5 |
| 3d | Full corpus (~40 tasks), split locked | $0 |
| M0-5 | Cache-behavior replication on Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 5 and Opus 5 (policy prerequisite) | a few dollars |
| 4a | Tuning split, all arms, 1 trial; ModelPilot parameters chosen | set from the pilot |
| 4b | Final split, all arms, 3 trials | about $100–400 as a first guess; refined from the 3c per-session cost |

Every paid phase prints its plan without `--live`, needs the user's key at a hidden prompt, and reports stop thresholds, which are not billing caps.

## Decisions still needed from the user

1. **Active mode for the ModelPilot arm only**, as described in the policy doc, before 4a.
2. **A budget for 4a and 4b**, set after the pilot measures cost per session.
3. **Repository list:** proposed after 3a surveys candidates, including licenses.

## Existing code reused

- `proxy.py` (wire accounting, governed reservations)
- `jev_route_check.reconcile` and `TOKEN_FIELDS`
- `governed_session` (isolated launch, hooks, key pre-check)
- `fixtures.scripted_response` (offline client driving)
- `m2` (output references), `workers` and `m4` (verified cascade), `governor.execute_fallback`
- `cache_probe` (M0 replication)
